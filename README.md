Introduction:
The "Cars" project aims to analyze and provide insights into a dataset obtained from Car Dekho, a popular online platform for buying and selling cars. The dataset contains information about various cars, including their make, model, year of manufacture, fuel type, and more. Through this project, we seek to uncover trends, patterns, and statistics related to the cars listed on the platform.
Dataset Source:
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Car Dekho. It includes comprehensive details about each car listing, such as the car's year, selling price, fuel type, transmission type, and other relevant attributes.
Issues Found in Data:
During the exploration of the dataset, several issues and challenges were identified, including:
•	Incomplete or missing data in certain fields.
•	Inconsistencies in the representation of fuel types.
•	Anomalies in the year field, such as outliers or incorrect entries.
•	Variability in the format of certain attributes.
Tools Used:
To perform the analysis and address the issues in the dataset, the following tools were employed:
•	SQL for querying and aggregating data.
•	(Add any other tools or programming languages you used, such as Python, Pandas, etc.)
Data Cleaning Process:
The data cleaning process involved several steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis results:
1.	Handling missing values: Missing data was either imputed or removed based on the context of each attribute.
2.	Standardizing fuel types: Inconsistencies in fuel type representation were resolved to create a uniform classification.
3.	Addressing anomalies in the year field: Outliers and incorrect entries were identified and corrected.
4.	Standardizing attribute formats: Formats of certain attributes were standardized for consistency.
Conclusion:
The analysis revealed valuable insights into the trends and patterns of car listings on Car Dekho. Key findings include the distribution of cars by year, the prevalence of different fuel types, and the count of cars exceeding certain thresholds. The project contributes to a better understanding of the dataset and can serve as a foundation for further analysis and decision-making in the automotive industry.
